Hello people, I've completed the Testing (Automated) (TASK 6) as a Web Development Intern under GRADUATE ROTATIONAL INTERNSHIP PROGRAM (GRIP) by the Sparks Foundation. In this project I used Selenium to create a test case to test the website thesparksfoundation.sg.

My task is to:

1. Read up about Testing.

2. Learn selenium and basic selenium automation scripting.

3. Start with Google Search and read tutorials. Watch videos to learn about various aspects of testing using selenium.

4. Use selenium to create a test case to test the website thesparksfoundation.sg

5. The test script should check of at least 5 pages and 10 elements in total.

6. Each element could be e.g. if the Logo exists, the navigation bar appears, the name on about us page is correct, etc.
